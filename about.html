        <h1>Srimad Bhagavad Gita</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    
    <p>The Bhagavad Gita manuscript is found in the sixth book of the Mahabharata manuscripts the Bhisma-parvan. Therein, in the third section, the Gita forms chapters 23–40, 
        that is 6.3.23 to 6.3.40. The Bhagavad Gita is often preserved and studied on its own,
        as an independent text with its chapters renumbered from 1 to 18.<br><br>The Bhagavad Gita manuscripts exist in numerous Indic scripts.
         These include writing systems that are currently in use, as well as early scripts such as the now dormant Sharada script.
         Variant manuscripts of the Gita have been found on the Indian subcontinent
        Unlike the enormous variations in the remaining sections of the surviving Mahabharata manuscripts, the Gita manuscripts show only minor variations.<br>

        According to Gambhirananda, the old manuscripts may have had 745 verses, though he agrees that “700 verses is the generally accepted historic standard.
        " Gambhirananda's view is supported by a few versions of chapter 6.43 of the Mahabharata. According to Gita exegesis scholar Robert Minor, these versions state that the 
        Gita is a text where "Kesava [Krishna] spoke 574 slokas, Arjuna 84, Sanjaya 41, and Dhritarashtra 1".
        <br><br>An authentic manuscript of the Gita with 745 verses has not been found.<br>Adi Shankaracharya, in his 8th-century commentary, explicitly states that the Gita has 700 verses,
         which was likely a deliberate declaration to prevent further insertions and changes to the Gita.
         Since Shankara's time, "700 verses" has been the standard benchmark for the critical edition of the Bhagavad Gita.</p>

        <h2>What is the Bhagavad-Gita?</h2>

        <p>The general understanding of the masses is that  Bhagavad-gita is a holy book of Hindu religion, an armchair book for the retirement years or an ancient 
            cripture full of philosophical intricacies. All these opinions make the Gita more or less outdated in the modern context. But by learning from the authorized sources, 
            one understands that Bhagavad-gita is much more than this. it is a guidebook to lead an enjoyable and blissful life. In other words, it is a user’s manual 
            to lead a meaningful human life.<br><br>

            Lord Krishna imparted this knowledge to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, when the latter was in a distressful condition. 
            Upon receiving this knowledge returned to his happy and stable position. All of us undergo difficult situations in life and often become overwhelmed by those 
            situations not knowing where to find a solution. Bhagavad-Gita guides us out of such delusions and reestablishes us in our original position of eternity,
             knowledge and bliss. If we follow the instructions as given by Lord Krishna, then we can attain the same blissful state as Arjuna did.</p>

        <h2>How relevant is it in modern times?</h2>
        <p>Everyone wants to be happy and everyone is constantly searching for that happiness. Whether a child or an old-man, an Indian or an American, Hindu or Christian, man or woman,
             everyone is looking for happiness. But unfortunately, for the want of real knowledge of happiness they are searching for it everywhere and getting frustrated. 
             Bhagavad-gita shows us where that happiness is. Just like when we purchase a new gadget, a user’s manual comes with it. The manual teaches us how to make the best use of 
             that gadget and derive maximum happiness out of it. For the want of proper knowledge we may invent our own ways of using it but finally we will become frustrated. 
             So, Bhagavad-gita is manual given by the Supreme Lord Krishna which guides us in making the best use of this human life and to deriving real happiness from it.<br><br>

            In the modern times when people are more confused and misdirected, the Gita become all the more relevant for the individual as well as the society at large in bringing back 
            the stability and happiness in life.</p>
